# Odin Project - Testing with Jest

## Overview

This project is part of **The Odin Project** curriculum. It focuses on writing JavaScript functions and testing them using **Jest**. The following functions were implemented and tested:

- `capitalize`: Capitalizes the first letter of a string.
- `reverseString`: Reverses a given string.
- `calculator`: A basic calculator object with methods for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- `caesarCipher`: Shifts each letter in a string by a given number of positions in the alphabet.
- `analyzeArray`: Returns an object with the average, min, max, and length of an array of numbers.

## Functions

### 1. `capitalize(string)`
- Capitalizes the first letter of the given string.

### 2. `reverseString(string)`
- Reverses the input string.

### 3. `calculator`
- An object with methods:
  - `add(a, b)`
  - `subtract(a, b)`
  - `multiply(a, b)`
  - `divide(a, b)`

### 4. `caesarCipher(string, shift)`
- Shifts each letter in the string by the specified shift value.

### 5. `analyzeArray(array)`
- Takes an array of numbers and returns an object with:
  - `average`
  - `min`
  - `max`
  - `length`

## Running Tests

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Run tests with Jest:
